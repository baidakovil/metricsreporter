# CodeMetricsConfig.txt - Strict thresholds for AI-driven development


# ==============================================
# CA1501: Avoid excessive inheritance
# ==============================================
# Only applies to Types
# Threshold level 5 or 6 is MS Advice
CA1501: 5


# ==============================================
# CA1502: Avoid excessive complexity
# ==============================================
# Methods: Very strict - force decomposition
# MS says 10 is good for projects with advantages, 15 good for others
CA1502(Method): 15

# Types: Moderate - allow reasonable number of simple methods
# For Types there should be other metrics like CC/LOC or IQR of CC
CA1502(Type): 100

# Namespaces: Relaxed - not actionable, number has no reason here
CA1502(Namespace): 500

# Assembly: Very relaxed - natural accumulation, number has no reason here
CA1502(Assembly): 5000


# ==============================================
# CA1505: Maintainability Index
# ==============================================
# Lower threshold = worse maintainability
# 0-9: Red (low), 10-19: Yellow (moderate), 20-100: Green (good)

# Methods: Require good maintainability
CA1505(Method): 30

# Types: Require good maintainability too
CA1505(Type): 30

# Namespaces
CA1505(Namespace): 40

# Assembly
CA1505(Namespace): 50


# ==============================================
# CA1506: Avoid excessive class coupling
# ==============================================
# Methods: Strict - minimize dependencies per method
# Threshold level 9 is MS Advice
CA1506(Method): 11

# Types: AI Advice was to rely on what you are coding: from 15 for core business service to 50 for adapter/facades/configurations
CA1506(Type): 40

# Namespaces: Relaxed - not actionable
CA1506(Namespace): 500

# Assembly: Very relaxed - not actionable
CA1506(Assembly): 5000
