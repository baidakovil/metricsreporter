## Explanation: Iterator and Async State Machine Coverage

C# compilers emit nested classes such as `Outer+<Method>d__0` to host iterator or async state, and OpenCover assigns most coverage metrics to those generated types. Without reconciliation, the original method would appear uncovered despite executing in production. Metrics Reporter fixes this through a dedicated reconciliation pass.

### Detection

`IteratorCoverageReconciler.TryExtractIteratorInfo` inspects every type created from OpenCover data:

1. Searches for `+<Method>d__N` tokens inside the fully qualified name.
2. Extracts the outer type FQN (left of `+`) and the original method name (inside `< >`).
3. Verifies the suffix follows the compiler pattern (`d__` plus an integer) to avoid false positives.

### Lookup

- The reconciler queries `AggregationWorkspaceState.Types` to locate the outer type node created earlier during aggregation.
- Inside that type, it scans `MemberMetricsNode` entries and uses `SymbolNormalizer.ExtractMethodName` to match the original method regardless of signature differences.

### Transfer decision

`HasNonZeroOpenCoverCoverage` evaluates both the iterator node and the original method:

| Iterator coverage | Method coverage | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Non-zero | Non-zero | Do nothing—both sources carry legitimate data. |
| Zero | Zero | Remove the iterator node entirely; it is pure noise. |
| Non-zero | Zero | Transfer metrics from iterator to method. |

### Metric transfer

`TransferIteratorCoverage` copies `OpenCoverSequenceCoverage`, `OpenCoverBranchCoverage`, and complexity metrics onto the method node, then hides the iterator node so the report tree stays clean. Baseline deltas and threshold evaluations operate on the updated method metrics, aligning CLI and HTML outputs with developer expectations.

### Why it matters

- Async/iterator methods no longer show `0%` coverage simply because OpenCover wrote to the state machine type.
- Threshold breaches surface on the human-authored methods, making reports actionable.
- HTML and `metrics-reader` stay in sync because both consume the reconciled tree.
