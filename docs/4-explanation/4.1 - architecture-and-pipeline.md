## Explanation: Architecture and End-to-End Pipeline

Metrics Reporter is a .NET 8 console application with a Spectre CLI (`metricsreporter`) that turns AltCover/OpenCover coverage, Roslyn metrics, and SARIF violations into a single JSON tree and HTML dashboard. This document explains the current pipeline.

### High-level flow

1. **Orchestration via CLI** – Commands `generate/read/readsarif/test` drive the flow. Optional PowerShell hooks (`scripts.generate`, `scripts.read.any`, `scripts.read.byMetric`) run first through `IProcessRunner` (pwsh, per-script timeout, stop on first non-zero). CI or user scripts must prepare inputs (coverage/metrics) explicitly.
2. **Document loaders** – Each data source has a minimal I/O component (AltCover, Roslyn metrics, SARIF). They read files into typed domain objects without aggregation logic.
3. **Parsers and walkers** – Roslyn metrics use `RoslynMetricsDocumentWalker`, AltCover uses `AltCoverMetricsParser`, SARIF uses `SarifDocumentAggregator`/`SarifRuleViolationFactory`. Parsers emit normalized `ParsedCodeElement` trees keyed by FQN.
4. **Aggregation** – `MetricsAggregationService` merges parsed trees into a single Solution → Member hierarchy. `StructuralElementMerger` reconciles nodes by FQN, `MemberFilter` removes compiler noise, metric dictionaries are combined using semantic rules (sums, chosen coverage values, etc.).
5. **Baseline + threshold evaluation** – `BaselineLifecycleService` can rotate baselines when `ReplaceMetricsBaseline` is enabled. `ThresholdEvaluator` compares metrics to `metadata.thresholdsByLevel` and computes `delta` vs. baseline.
6. **Suppression analysis** – `SuppressedSymbolsService` (when configured) scans source roots from `SourceCodeFolders` and maps `[SuppressMessage]` attributes to metric identifiers (e.g., `CA1506 → RoslynClassCoupling`). Results merge into the report so UI/CLI can hide suppressed entries by default.
7. **Rendering** – `HtmlTableGenerator` plus the JS bundle transform the JSON tree into `MetricsReport.html`; scripts handle filtering, detailing/awareness sliders, tooltips, and persisted state without rebuilding the DOM.

### Key design decisions

- **Strict symbol normalization** – `SymbolNormalizer` converts AltCover `Namespace.Type::Method(Args)` and Roslyn `void Type.Method(...)` into the same `Namespace.Type.Method(...)` format. Without this, the aggregator would produce duplicate nodes and inaccurate deltas.
- **Failure on duplicate coverage** – If the same symbol appears in two AltCover XML files, the parser throws. This prevents silently overwriting coverage from parallel runs.
- **Interface-first services** – Every major subsystem exposes interfaces (`IMetricsReportPipeline`, `IBaselineLifecycleService`, `ISuppressedSymbolsService`, etc.) so tests can substitute fakes and CLI commands stay decoupled from implementation details.
- **HTML-first UX** – Detail/Awareness sliders, all/changes/new toggles, and `localStorage` persistence were prioritized because the dashboard is the main entry point for humans. The UI is intentionally ES5-compatible and relies on precomputed caches for performance on large solutions (>50k nodes).

### Threading and performance

- The console app runs on a single thread—it processes parsed documents sequentially to keep the logic deterministic and to simplify future AI maintenance.
- `System.Text.Json` with pooled buffers writes the final report without intermediate allocations.
- AltCover / Roslyn / SARIF parsing remains the largest cost, so each parser only loads what it needs and discards the rest immediately. Iterator coverage reconciliation and suppression analysis operate on in-memory dictionaries to avoid repeated traversals.

### Extending the pipeline

- **New metrics** – Add descriptors in `MetricDescriptorCatalog`, extend `MetricIdentifier`, update `thresholdsByLevel`, and ensure the HTML renderer knows how to format the new metric (unit, color rules).
- **Additional data sources** – Implement `IDocumentLoader` + `IDocumentParser` pair that emits `ParsedCodeElement` nodes. Hook the parser into `MetricsReportPipeline` before `MetricsAggregationService`.
- **Custom dashboards** – Consumers can ignore `MetricsReport.html` and build their own visualizations from `MetricsReport.g.json`, but they must preserve the schema documented in the reference section to remain compatible with `metrics-reader`.

### Baseline rotation summary

1. `ReplaceMetricsBaseline=true` (MSBuild property) activates automatic rotation.
2. Before aggregation, if the baseline file is missing but the previous report exists, copy the report to the baseline path.
3. After generating the new report, archive the old baseline to `MetricsReportStoragePath` with a timestamp suffix and overwrite the baseline with the fresh report.
4. Subsequent runs immediately have deltas ready—no manual copies required.

### HTML dashboard highlights

- **Detailing slider** – Limits tree depth (Namespace → Type → Member). Uses cached parent-child maps; no DOM rebuild.
- **Awareness slider** – Switches between All/Warning/Error, automatically keeping ancestor rows visible so context isn’t lost.
- **Filter box** – Debounced at 200 ms, matches substrings across FQN, rule IDs, and file paths. Results toggle `data-hiddenByFilter`.
- **Tooltips** – One tooltip host reused for metrics, suppressions, and symbols to avoid dozens of event handlers.
- **Actions** – Buttons for “Expand all”, “Collapse all”, copy/canonical link, `localStorage` reset. Clipboard operations rely on the modern `navigator.clipboard` API with a fallback.

Understanding these decisions helps diagnose regressions (e.g., mismatched FQNs, missing deltas, sluggish dashboards) and guides future improvements.
