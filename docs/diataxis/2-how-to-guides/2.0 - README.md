| Guide | When to use it |
| --- | --- |
| [`2.1 - run-from-source.md`](./2.1%20-%20run-from-source.md) | You want to execute `metricsreporter` straight from the source tree without installing the tool package. |
| [`2.2 - ship-metricsreporter-update.md`](./2.2%20-%20ship-metricsreporter-update.md) | You need to bump the package/tool version, publish to the local feed, and consume it from another repo. |
