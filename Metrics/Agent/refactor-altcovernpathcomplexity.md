Refactor code in the given namespace to achieve the required OpenCover NPath Complexity metric: the metric value must be no more than 200 for methods.

## Requirements

- Use the `metricsreporter` CLI to update and retrieve metric values for symbols requiring refactoring, one request at a time. Description and usage examples are provided in `@3.2 - metricsreporter-cli.md`.
- Strictly follow the workflow described below to achieve the goal: reduce the metric for all symbols in the namespace mentioned above to acceptable limits.
- When reducing OpenCover NPath Complexity, use simplification techniques that shrink the number of independent decision paths:
	•	Use guard clauses and early returns to short-circuit invalid states before deeper branching multiplies paths.  
	•	Flatten nested `if/else` trees by merging related conditions into single predicates or helper methods that encapsulate one decision.  
	•	Convert large decision matrices into data-driven tables or dictionaries mapping keys to handlers/results instead of long branching sequences.  
	•	Isolate unrelated checks into separate, focused methods so each method owns a smaller decision tree and does not compound paths with other concerns.  
	•	Remove duplicated or unreachable branches; normalize boolean expressions to avoid redundant combinations that inflate path counts.  
	•	Prefer pattern matching or `switch` expressions for mutually exclusive cases, keeping each branch lean and avoiding nested branching inside branches.  
- It is **forbidden to use "dummy" classes and methods**, i.e., delegation wrapper methods created solely to reduce the metric but lacking architectural meaning. Prefer suppression in case when there is no way to reduce metrics further.
- Follow SOLID principles and the rules established in the project.
- Maintain nullable reference type annotations correctly when refactoring.

## Strictly follow this instruction until all symbols are fixed

### 1. Get problematic symbol

Using the `metricsreporter read` command, get the first "problematic" symbol that requires refactoring. A problematic symbol is one where the threshold is exceeded (`metricsreporter` handles this comparison automatically).

Example request to `metricsreporter` with the required options:

```powershell
dotnet tool run metricsreporter read --namespace <given_namespace> --metric OpenCoverNPathComplexity --symbol-kind Member
```

If you receive a message that no suitable symbols are found (instead of an object with fields `symbolFqn`, `symbolType`, `metric`, `value`, `threshold`, `delta`, `filePath`, `status`, `isSuppressed`), this means there are no problematic symbols: complete the task.

### 2. Analyze symbol

Begin working on the symbol. Study the code of the class or method and related classes and methods. Make a decision about the possibility of refactoring.

There is only one reason to cancel refactoring: refactoring should not be performed if further simplification techniques lead to deterioration in code readability and maintainability. If refactoring is canceled, make a suppression for the symbol. Example suppression:

```csharp
[System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.SuppressMessage(
    "OpenCover",
    "NPathComplexity",
    Justification = "Complex decision tree cannot be reduced without obscuring domain rules; data-driven refactoring attempts still keep path count above the required threshold.")]
```

If refactoring is canceled, add the suppression to the code and start from step 1.

### 3. Perform refactoring

If refactoring is possible, proceed as follows:

1. Plan the refactoring.
2. Perform the refactoring. Update XML documentation for all modified public members according to project rules.
3. Verify that the solution build is successful: `dotnet build --no-incremental`. If the build fails, fix the code until the build is green. Use the test-driven-development method (red-refactor-green).
4. Check that there are no compiler warnings or errors in the modified files. If there are, fix them.
5. After verifying the build, check that tests pass: `dotnet test --no-build`. If tests fail, fix the code as described in the previous step.

### 4. Verify result

Using the `metricsreporter test` command, verify that the symbol you worked on is fixed.

Example request to `metricsreporter` with the required options:

```powershell
dotnet tool run metricsreporter test --symbol <symbol_been_refactored> --metric OpenCoverNPathComplexity
```

If you see `"isOk": false` in the response, return to step 2 with this symbol. The number of additional refactoring attempts to achieve the required metric: 5 attempts per symbol. If after the fifth additional attempt the required metric is not achieved, then add a suppression attribute with a Justification message in English that fully explains the essence of the problem, if any (for example, that five attempts were insufficient for a proper refactoring), or simply a description of the reason why this symbol cannot be refactored (for example, that it contains complex business logic with many conditional branches that cannot be simplified without losing domain clarity).

If `"isOk": true`, proceed to the next symbol as described in step 1.
