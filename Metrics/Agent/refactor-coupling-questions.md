# Refactoring Quality Review

After completing refactoring according to the rules in `@docs/refactor/refactor-coupling.md`, review each symbol (method or class) that was created or refactored in this session.

Summary of the my refactoring with the list of symbol:

## --- Summary Start ---

Refactored the `` namespace to reduce Class coupling:



## --- Summary End ---

## Review Criteria

### 1. SOLID Principles Assessment

**Question:** Does this symbol genuinely play a role in SOLID principles, or is it a wrapper created solely to reduce metrics?

**Answer format:** Provide six lines:
- Five lines, each addressing one of the five SOLID principles (S, O, L, I, D)
- Sixth line: A verdict on a 5-point scale (1-5) indicating how well the symbol adheres to SOLID principles

### 2. Best Practices and Project Rules Compliance

**Question:** Does this symbol correspond to best practices and comply with `@.cursor/rules/dotnet-design-pattern-review.mdc`, `@.cursor/rules/instructions.mdc`, and Microsoft recommendations?

**Answer format:** Be brief:
- If the symbol is written professionally: one line describing its advantages
- If there are problems: one line per problem and one line per non-compliance with instructions in the `.mdc` files

### 3. Improvement Recommendations

**Question:** If there are problems with the SOLID role or compliance with rules, can this symbol be improved or removed?

**Answer format:** Describe:
- Whether it can be improved using decoupling techniques: Dependency Injection, interfaces, DTOs, method extraction, etc.
- Whether it can be removed entirely
- If removal is recommended, note that it may imply growth of dependencies in the parent class, which should be assigned a justified `SuppressMessage` attribute

## Review Guidelines

Be objective and honest in your assessment. Treat the code responsibly, with attention to instructions and the codebase style. Follow the same standards used when evaluating whether to suppress a symbol during refactoring.
